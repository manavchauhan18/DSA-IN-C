A data structure is a way to store and organize data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently. 

ABSTRACT DATA TYPE(ADT) - defines data and operations but no implementation.

ARRAY VS LINKED LIST

1) Cost of accessing an element -

Array - Constant time [O(1)]
Linked List - O(n)

2) Memory Requirement -

Array - Fixed size
Linked List - Dynamically allocated whenever required [Extra memory for the pointer variable]

Array - memory may not be available as one large block
Linked List - memory may be available as multiple small blocks

3) Cost of inserting and deleting an element

Array :-

a) At beginning - O(n)
b) At end - O(1) => if array is not full ;; O(n) => array full
c) At ith position - O(n)

Linked List :-

a) At beginning - O(1)
b) At end - O(n)
c) At ith position - O(n)

4) Ease of use

Array - Easy to implement
Linked List - More prone to errors when using C or C++
